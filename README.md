# Embyte

Free open-source minimalistic embed creator. You can use the embeds in iFrames.

## Motivation

I liked the web-embeds from discord and other social media. I thought it'd be good to implement a general solution. Personally, I'll use the iFrames in my obsidian vault.

## Conventions

- `tw...` Attributes refer to usage in or with tailwind-classes
- Reusable components are stored in the `Shared`-folder, Pages in `Pages`
- static content is located in `static`, not `wwwroot`
- Account-related components such as a login-page belong to `identity` (which exists in both frontend-folders)
- Frequently used components are stored in `Shared/base`, seperated into subfolders for each respective group
- Important constants, and "magic"-values are stored in the `Constants` class 
- C# Classes, like a dbManager are located in the modules-folder

## Thank you
